# Seattle Home Price Prediction

The goal of this project is to characterize the Seattle housing market with multiple forms of machine learning, as well as predict home prices for the city. After some initial data analysis, it seems that there are no missing rows and the dataset itself is fairly clean. There are some areas that need more digging, for instance, looking at duplicate homes for re-sale continuity, checking distributions of continuous variables, and looking for typos in categorical variables.

As I get further along in the project I will continue to update this space to clarify current goals and provide an explanation for what has been done so far.
